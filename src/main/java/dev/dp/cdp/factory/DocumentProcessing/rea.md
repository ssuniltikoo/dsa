# Simple Factory Pattern for Document Processing
## Problem Statement
### You are designing a document processing application. Depending on the type of document (e.g., text, spreadsheet, presentation), different processing routines are required. You need a way to create document processors without explicitly specifying their classes, ensuring the application is open for future document types.

## Assignment
### Your task is to implement the Simple Factory pattern to create document processors in the document processing application. The Simple Factory pattern provides a way to create objects without exposing the instantiation logic, allowing for easy addition of new document processor types.

### Task 1 - Creating a Common Parent Class - Product Hierarchy
## To streamline the creation of document processors, implement the common parent class named DocumentProcessor. This class should include attributes and methods that are common to all document processors. The method supportsType has already been abstracted out for you as an example. You will need to implement the DocumentProcessor class as a common parent class for all document processors.

### Task 2 - Implementing the Simple Factory
### Implement a DocumentProcessorFactory class that follows the Simple Factory pattern. This class should have a method to create document processors based on the DocumentType. The factory class should be capable of creating different types of document processors based on the DocumentType. Also remember that to create a document processor, you need to pass the document name as a parameter as well.

Instructions
## Implement the DocumentProcessor class as a common parent class for all document processors. Include attributes and methods that are common to all document processors.

## Implement the DocumentProcessorFactory class that implements the Simple Factory pattern. Add a method to create document processors based on DocumentType and other parameters.

## Run the provided test cases in the DocumentProcessorTest class to verify the correctness of your implementation. The tests will check if all document processors have a common parent class and if the factory class can correctly create document processors based on the document type and name.
