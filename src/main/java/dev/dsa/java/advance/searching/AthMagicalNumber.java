/*
    You are given three positive integers, A, B, and C.

Any positive integer is magical if divisible by either B or C.

Return the Ath smallest magical number. Since the answer may be very large, return modulo 109 + 7.

Note: Ensure to prevent integer overflow while calculating.

A -  10

B = 2

C =  3

 2 3  4  6  8 9 10 12 14 15
 1 2  3  4  5 6 7  8  9 10

 numbers divisible by B and C in range from [1 to M ] would be
 e.g list of numbers didviisble by 2 and 3 in range from [ 1 to 10] would be

 10/2 + 10/3 - 10/6 = 5 + 3 - 1 = 7
